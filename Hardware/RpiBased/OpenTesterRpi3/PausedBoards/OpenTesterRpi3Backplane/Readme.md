This folder holds all files for the OpenTester (Raspberry Pi 3 based) Backplane Board. 
The board is supposed to provide the connections to all (currently 5) extension boards as well as a Raspberry Pi 3 and a power supply. 
A board extension connector should be added to allow for further expansion.
This board is mainly to be used during development and could theorectically be replaced with a stackable connector (or even a ribbon cable) and a specialized power supply board.
